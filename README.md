# TileVania

TileVania is a 2D platform game made in a week with a simple UI to practice mechanics and game design. 

The game is composed of three levels(For now). Each level is to test/experiment with a certain mechanism in the game.

## Warning 

I don't own the sprites used in the game. If you want to use them commercialy, buy them from unity's Asset store
